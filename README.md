## Requirements

- [NodeJS 20+](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://npm.io) (or equivalent)

## Getting Started

Getting started is a simple as cloning the repository

```
git clone git@github.com:ninech/pricing-calculator.git
```

Changing into the new directory

```
cd pricing-calculator
```

Removing the .git folder (and any additional files, folders or dependencies you may not need)

```
rm -rf .git
```

Installing dependencies

```
npm install
```

```
npm run setup
```

Congrats! You're ready to starting working on that new project!

If you'd rather run the commands above in one go, check out the command below:

```
git clone git@github.com:ninech/pricing-calculator.git &&\
cd pricing-calculator &&\
rm -rf .git &&\
npm install &&\
npm run setup
```

**Note**: This project comes with two git hooks added by [husky](https://typicode.github.io/husky/). A prepare-commit-msg hook to run the [Commitizen](https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli#readme) cli for those nice commit messages and a commit-msg hook to run [Commitlint](https://commitlint.js.org/#/) on the message itself. Commitlint will ensure the commit message follows the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) (it will if you used commitizen).

If you wish to remove any hooks, simply delete the corresponding file in the .husky directory.

## Important Note

1. This boilerplate project does not include a demo. At most, a few utilities (types, devtools, initial home page routes) are included. There is no glue to get in your way when trying to modify the template.

2. Due to empty directories not being included in git commits, placeholder README files have been added to these empty directories. These README files contain simple descriptions about how the different directories in the accompanying folder structure may be used. As an example check out the [recommended component organizational structure](src/components/README.md) as well as the [recommended folder structure](src/features/README.md).

3. [Faker](https://fakerjs.dev/) is included to encourage more isolated testing and allow for rapid development of demos and MVPs. However, please make note that, [due to a bug](https://github.com/faker-js/faker/issues/1791), importing Faker from the main package (without a locale) will result in the entire Faker lib being imported causing bundle sizes to increase up to 2+ MB. Instead prefer [localized imports](https://fakerjs.dev/guide/localization.html#individual-localized-packages) as shown below.

   ```
   // import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker';
   import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker/locale/en'; // prefer localization when possible
   ```

   The imported lib will instead be around 600 KB. Nonetheless, Faker should **NOT** be used in production and instead be limited to testing and demos.

## Testing

Unit testing is handled by React Testing Library, Jest, swc while End-to-End (E2E) Testing is conducted by Playwright.

If you'd like to run all tests, Unit and E2E alike, execute the following command:

```
npm run test
```

### Unit Testing

When running unit test scripts, it is assumed that unit tests will be colocated with the source files. Take a look at the placeholder README file in `src/components` for [an example](src/components/README.md).

If you'd like to execute unit tests specifically, the below command will execute test:

```
npm run test
```

All unit tests run in watch mode by default. If you'd like to disable watch mode, change the package.json test scripts with the following

before:

```
"scripts": {
  	"test": "jest",
}
```

**Note**: Faker is included to provide mock data. See the [Important Note](#important-note) section for crucial details regarding this package. Specifically, point 3.

### End-to-End (E2E) Testing

Running E2E tests use a similar syntax to running unit tests:

```
npm run test:e2e
```

If you wish to see the reports, run:

```
npm run test:e2e:report
```

## Preparing for Deployment

Deploying is as easy as running

```
npm run build
```

and pointing your web server to the generated `index.html` file found at `dist/index.html`

### Continuous Integration

Due to the vast array of tools, opinions, requirements and preferences a CI template is not included in this project.

## Devtools

This project includes a set of Devtools. Some are additional package dependencies whereas others come built-in to the packages themselves.

### Devtool dependencies:

- [@tanstack/react-query-devtools](https://tanstack.com/query/v4/docs/react/devtools) - Dedicated dev tools to help visualize the inner workings of React Query
- [@hookform/DevTools](https://react-hook-form.com/dev-tools) - React Hook Form Devtools to help debug forms with validation

A set of utility components are provided in `src/components/utils/development-tools/`. These [wrapper components](https://tanstack.com/router/v1/docs/devtools#only-importing-and-using-devtools-in-developmentgit) check whether the application is running in development or production mode and render the component or null respectively. In other words, you can confidently use them during development without having to worry about them showing up for end users in production.

**TanStack Query Devtools** are ready to go out of the box. The development vs. production rendering mechanism is built into the devtools. If you do wish to [render the devtools in production](https://tanstack.com/query/latest/docs/react/devtools) you can freely do so by following the TanStack Query Devtools documentation. The devtools component can be found in `src/App.tsx`.

When running the application in development mode you can find the TanStack Query Devtools icon in the bottom left corner of the page sporting the [React Query Logo](https://img.stackshare.io/service/25599/default_c6db7125f2c663e452ba211df91b2ced3bb7f0ff.png).

**React Hook Form DevTools** icon can be recognized in the top right corner of the page by the pink React Hook Form clipboard logo. A utility component has also provided. Like the TanStack Table Devtools component above, a prop must be passed from a specific hook. In this case, it is the control prop from the `useForm()` hook. Similar to TanStack Table, use of React Hook Form DevTools requires the component be added to each unique form. More information can be found in the [React Hook Form DevTools documentation](https://react-hook-form.com/dev-tools).

To reiterate, if you wish to restrict the Devtools to development builds use the provided components found at `src/components/utils/development-tools` instead of the built-in components from their respective modules.

### Built-in Devtools:

- Zustand

**Zustand** provides a built-in [devtools middleware](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand#redux-devtools) for use with [Redux DevTools](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux-devtools#redux-devtools).
